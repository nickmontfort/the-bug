            dedicated to Mark Klink


        the text transformation concept, though discordant, was inspired by
        the much more pleasant Translation by John Cayley, see
        https://collection.eliterature.org/1/works/cayley__translation.html

        the texts are approximate (glitched?) quotations from well-known stories

        thanks to Alexia Manzano-Schlamp for her help with the German text!
